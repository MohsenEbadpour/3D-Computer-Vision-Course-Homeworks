# 3D Computer Vision Course Homeworks

Welcome to the 3D Computer Vision Course Homeworks repository! This collection of projects represents the culmination of my studies in the 3D Computer Vision course, which I undertook during the Spring of 2023 at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) under the instruction of Dr. M. Javanmardi. I'm proud to share that I achieved the highest score in the course and placed first(20/20).

## Course Overview

This course covered a wide array of topics in 3D computer vision, and the homework assignments encompassed three main projects:

1. **Single View Geometry**: This project delved into fundamental concepts of single-view geometry, including depth estimation, camera calibration, 3D-2D transformations, vanishing lines and points, projective and affine transformations, Cholesky decomposition, and camera pose estimation.

2. **Point Cloud Registration**: In this project, I explored point cloud registration techniques, covering topics such as Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), Normal Distributions Transform (NDT), Iterative Closest Point (ICP), map generation and updating, point cloud processing, and the use of the KITTI dataset.

3. **Unsupervised Learning of Depth**: This project revolved around unsupervised learning methods for depth estimation. Topics included Structure from Motion, Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation, Optical Flow, FlowNetS, and Transfer Learning.

## Final Project

As part of the course requirements, I completed a unique final project. My final project focused on point cloud classification using a hybrid approach that combined PointNet and Self-Attention Graph Pooling. Further details and the full description of my final project are available [PointNet meets Self-Attention Graph Pooling: A Synergistic Approach to Point Cloud Classification](https://github.com/MohsenEbadpour/PointNet-meets-Self-Attention-Graph-Pooling-A-Synergistic-Approach-to-Point-Cloud-Classification).
